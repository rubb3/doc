 His interest in technology began at Florida State University, where, in the late 1960s, he obtained his degree in experimental psychology, conducting research in their computer-assisted instruction laboratory. He moved to the University of Texas at Austin, where he co-directed their computer-assisted instruction lab and attained tenure. In 1975, O'Neil was recruited to join the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, where he ran a program on computer-based learning, including PLATO IV.
